# open-astrophysics-learning-lab
A beginner-friendly, Python-based introduction to stellar astrophysics and HR diagrams.
Open Astrophysics Learning Lab
Learning Stellar Astrophysics Through Real Data and Python

This project is a free, beginner-friendly introduction to astrophysics using real astronomical concepts and Python programming.
It is designed for high school students who are curious about stars, data, and how astronomers actually study the universe.

Instead of only learning theory, students will analyze stellar data, calculate magnitudes, and plot Hertzsprung–Russell (HR) diagrams using Python.

Who is this for?

This course is meant for:

High school students interested in astronomy or physics

Beginners who know basic Python or are willing to learn

Students who want hands-on experience with real astrophysics concepts

No advanced math or prior astrophysics knowledge is required.

What problem does this course solve?

Many students learn astronomy only from textbooks, without ever working with real data.
This course bridges that gap by introducing students to data-driven astronomy, the way modern astrophysics is actually done.

Students don’t just read — they compute, plot, and interpret.

What will you learn?

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

Understand stellar color, brightness, and classification

Learn what the Hertzsprung–Russell Diagram represents

Calculate absolute magnitude from apparent magnitude

Plot HR diagrams using Python

Interpret star populations such as main sequence stars and white dwarfs

Course Structure

Module 1: Introduction to Stellar Data
Understanding what astronomical data is and how stars are described using numbers.

Module 2: Star Classification and HR Diagrams
Learning how stars are classified and how the HR diagram explains stellar evolution.

Module 3: Introduction to Spectroscopy
Understanding how astronomers use light to study stars.

Practical Lab:
Students use Python to calculate absolute magnitudes and plot HR diagrams using real-style data.
